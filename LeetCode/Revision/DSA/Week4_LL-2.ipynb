    "Problem Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tInput:\n",
    "\t•\tYou are given a singly linked list (e.g., 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None).\n",
    "\t•\tYou are also given an integer k which is a positive number (e.g., k = 2).\n",
    "\t2.\tObjective:\n",
    "\t•\tReverse the nodes of the linked list in groups of k nodes at a time.\n",
    "\t•\tIf the number of nodes is not a multiple of k, reverse the remaining nodes as well.\n",
    "\t3.\tOutput:\n",
    "\t•\tYou need to return the modified linked list where the nodes have been reversed in groups of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None and k = 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for solving this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tStep 1: Reverse the first group of 2 nodes (1 -> 2 becomes 2 -> 1).\n",
    "\t2.\tStep 2: Reverse the next group of 2 nodes (3 -> 4 becomes 4 -> 3).\n",
    "\t3.\tStep 3: Since only 1 node (5) is left, it remains as it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Output : 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> None\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the linked list is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None and k = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for solving this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tStep 1: Reverse the first group of 3 nodes (1 -> 2 -> 3 becomes 3 -> 2 -> 1).\n",
    "\t2.\tStep 2: Since only 2 nodes (4 -> 5) are left, reverse them (4 -> 5 becomes 5 -> 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output becomes: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> None\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tYou need to reverse the nodes in groups. The group size is determined by k.\n",
    "\t•\tAfter reversing a group of k nodes, you move on to the next group and reverse that as well.\n",
    "\t•\tIf the list has fewer than k nodes remaining at any point, simply reverse the remaining nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tFor k = 2:\n",
    "\t•\tBefore reversal: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None\n",
    "\t•\tAfter reversal in groups of 2: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> None\n",
    "\t2.\tFor k = 3:\n",
    "\t•\tBefore reversal: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None\n",
    "\t•\tAfter reversal in groups of 3: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> None\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tYou are not just swapping the values; you are rearranging the actual pointers between nodes.\n",
    "\t•\tYou need to handle edge cases, such as when the list is empty, or k is greater than the remaining nodes in the list."
